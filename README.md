# üí´ About Me:
üî≠ I Have done MCA (2021-24) from NITC and have done my B.sc (2017-20) in Physics, Math, Statistics from BHU.</br>
üå±  I have gained pretty much good knowledge in DSA, Full stack development and Data science, along with core CS concepts like DBMS, OS, OOPS, Computer Networks.</br>
üå± I'm interested in both software development as well as creating ML models </br>
üå± I really enjoy creating software products that people going to use. I derive great pleasure from coding and brainstorming technical solutions for software. I love working on challenging projects, constantly learning about new technologies, may be this line feels a little bit praising yourself but it's true to some extend.</br>
üå± Along with these, I'm really a good at sports, i have won my medals and certificates in different sports like cricket, football, volleyball,   etc.</br>

# My Academic Life in Nitc
My coding journey began in the first semester of my MCA program.  I started with fundamental computer science subjects like logic design, Intro to programming in c, statistics, etc. This only semester was online so progress was a bit slow.

In the second semester(offline), We have DSA in C( theory + lab) it was most challenging but also most learning semester. Got to know about trees, graphs, disjoint set, hashing as well as created algorithms from scratch and different methods for processing and manipulation on these data structure. In this semester built my first web application, a "Hostel Management" system, using Ruby on Rails framework, learnt more about HTML, css, JS, and bootsrap my part was mostly fronted .¬†This semester also saw me delve into  MIPS assembly language as part course computer organization and architecture, I was pretty good in graph theory and my initial exploration of machine learning started into this semester. This was the most energetic semester made new friends as well did lots of learning compare to all others coming semesters(it was the best semester in all perspective).

The third semester focused on object-oriented programming (OOP) with a strong emphasis on both theoretical and practical aspects.  Additionally, I studied Database Management Systems (DBMS), gained practical experience with operating systems (OS) and command-line interfaces (CLI), and continued honing my coding skills like DP.  During this time, I completed several projects:
OS Project: Developed an Enigma machine program for encoding and decoding messages at the kernel level.OOP Lab Project: Created a desktop application called "Lost and Found" using Java.

The fourth semester heavily emphasized data science and machine learning we had to build all basic ML models from scratch along with practical and theoretical lab test on each topic, complemented by courses on computer networks and the software development lifecycle.  I also created a desktop application named "NITC Travel Together" in Java. Created Object classification Application using Deep learning

In the fifth semester, I continued to solidify my knowledge through data science and data mining practices.  I also completed a DBMS lab project and built an "Online Blood Forum" application using Flask(Python framework), Html, css, js and SQLite.

sixth semester: I had to created a project on a remote sensing and machine learning related project focused on "Crop mapping using fused optical-radar dataset."

Along with study, there were many extracurricular activities like i played many tournaments including cricket, football volleyball. And many other things...
